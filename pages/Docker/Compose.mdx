## Purpose
Docker compose allows multiple containers to be configured in a single YAML file.

## Sample

```yaml {15-16}
version: '3.1'

services:

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: always
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

  api:
    build: .
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

> By default, all containers defined in the same compose file share the same network. Container ports can be published with the `ports` property.
