# Limited Direct Execution

> At boot time, the kernel initializes the trap table, and the CPU remembers its location for subsequent use.

## Trap vs Interrupt

Traps changes a program from user mode to kernel mode to execute instructions at a privileged level (syscalls), while interrupts are invoked by the hardware.

## System Call

Typical user applications run in user mode, and use a system call to trap into the kernel to request operating system services.

## Context Switch

The OS save a few register values for the currently-executing process and restore a few for the soon-to-be-executing process.

## Timer Interrupt

The timer interrupt gives the OS the ability to run again on a CPU even if processes act in a non-cooperative fashion.
