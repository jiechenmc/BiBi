# Preface

I have taken many systems classes, whether that's Systems Fundamentals I & II and Gradute Operating Systems. I found this [book](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) through many recommendation and includes my favorite topics about OS (Virtualization and Concurrency). Hopefully I can finish this book by the end of Summer 2024.
