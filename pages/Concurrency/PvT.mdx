> Processes are more expensive to create and destroy compared to threads.

Processes can have many threads and each process has a separate address space. Threads share the address space of the process that created them. As you can imagine, creating and tearing down threads is cheaper than processes.

The following examples will be written in `Node.js` since it shares similiar APIs to `C`.

## Process

### Creating

### Reaping

## Thread

In Node.js, threads are managed by the operaing system. In [Go](/Go/Goroutines), this is managed by the runtime.
