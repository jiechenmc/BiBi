# Locks

There are many different type of locks available and their purpose is to provide mutual exclusion or to protect resources from concurrent access.

## Spinlock

A spinlock waits (spins) for a lock to become available.

## Readersâ€“writer lock

A RW Lock favors readers over writers. Readers can keep acquiring the lock and hold on to it long enough to starve the writer.

## Seqlock

A sequence lock keeps a sequence # at the start and at the end of entering a critical region. If start != end, retry the operation.

## RCU

RCU only require locks for writes. When a write happens, a copy of the element is made, then updates it, and make it public by changing the next pointer of the previous element. The old copy of the element will be freed when the refcount to it drops to 0.
